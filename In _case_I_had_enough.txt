@News/Updates 
Due to me having an argument with some people very influential in the development of WorldSprites, I will lock down this Discord server for a indefinite amount of time. All channels will be locked. I don't know if WorldSprites will ever release, or if I am ever going to make games, or any other type of content online again.
I know stuff like this happened before, and I always came back because most of them were meaningless small things, but I doubt this will end up the same this time.
Please don't DM me, or anyone else involved. Don't harass people and don't bother them. Don't stalk anyone on social media or invade their personal life.

I enjoyed working on WorldSprites and building a group of friends while doing it. I wish that it would have stayed that way for more than it did, and that stuff like this wouldn't have happened every few months.
With stuff like this happening all the time I lost motivation to work on anything, even the things I dedicated most of my life to.

Goodbye for the last time!
